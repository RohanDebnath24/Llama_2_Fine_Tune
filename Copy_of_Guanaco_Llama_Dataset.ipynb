Requests to the SageMaker API and console are made over a secure (SSL) connection. You pass AWS Identity and Access Management roles to SageMaker to provide permissions to access resources on your behalf for training and deployment. You can use encrypted S3 buckets for model artifacts and data, as well as pass a KMS key to SageMaker notebooks, training jobs, and endpoints, to encrypt the attached ML storage volume.\", \"found_duplicate\": false}\n",

The result is the best performing model that you can deploy at a fraction of the time normally required to train the model. You get full visibility into how the model was created and whats in it and SageMaker Autopilot integrates with Amazon SageMaker Studio. You can explore up to 50 different models generated by SageMaker Autopilot inside SageMaker Studio so its easy to pick the best model for your use case.

The start-up time of launching the UI to read and execute a notebook is faster than the instance based notebooks. You also have the flexibility to choose from a large collection of instance types from within the UI at any time. You will no longer need to go to the AWS console to start new instances and port over your notebooks. Each user has a isolated home directory independent of a particular instance. This directory is automatically mounted into all notebook servers and kernels as theyre started, so you can access your notebooks and other files even when you switch instances to view and run your notebooks.

            "<s>[INST] How does Managed Spot Training work? [/INST] Managed Spot Training uses Amazon EC2 Spot instances for training, and these instances can be pre-empted when AWS needs capacity. As a result, Managed Spot Training jobs can run in small increments as and when capacity becomes available. The training jobs need not be restarted from scratch when there is an interruption as Amazon SageMaker can resume the training jobs using the latest model checkpoint. The built-in frameworks and the built-in computer vision algorithms with SageMaker enable periodic checkpoints, and you can enable checkpoints with custom models.</s>\n",
            "<s>[INST] Do I need to periodically checkpoint with Managed Spot Training? [/INST] We recommend periodic checkpoints as a general best practice for long running training jobs.

            "<s>[INST] Will you recommend specific hyperparameters for tuning? [/INST] No. How certain hyperparameters impact the model performance depends on various factors and it is hard to definitively say one hyperparameter is more important than the others and thus needs to be tuned. For built-in algorithms within Amazon SageMaker, we do call out whether or not a hyperparameter is tunable.</s>\n",
            "<s>[INST] How long does a hyperparameter tuning job take? [/INST] The length of time for a hyperparameter tuning job depends on multiple factors including the size of the data, the underlying algorithm, and the values of the hyperparameters.

            "<s>[INST] Can I optimize multiple objectives simultaneously like a model to be both fast and accurate? [/INST] Not at this time. Right now, you need to specify a single objective metric to optimize or change your algorithm code to emit a new metric, which is a weighted average between two or more useful metrics, and have the tuning process optimize towards that objective metric.</s>\n",
            "<s>[INST] How much does Automatic Model Tuning cost? [/INST] There is no charge for a hyperparameter tuning job itself. You will be charged by the training jobs that are launched by the hyperparameter tuning job, based on model training pricing.</s>\n",

[/INST] Amazon SageMaker Autopilot automates everything in a typical machine learning workflow, including feature preprocessing, algorithm selection, and hyperparameter tuning, while specifically focusing on classification and regression use cases. Automatic Model Tuning, on the other hand, is designed to tune any model, no matter whether it is based on built-in algorithms, deep learning frameworks, or custom containers.

            "<s>[INST] When should I use reinforcement learning? [/INST] While the goal of supervised learning techniques is to find the right answer based on the patterns in the training data, the goal of unsupervised learning techniques is to find similarities and differences between data points. In contrast, the goal of reinforcement learning techniques is to learn how to achieve a desired outcome even when it is not clear how to accomplish that outcome.

            " {\"question\": \"Will you recommend specific hyperparameters for tuning?\", \"answer\": \"No. How certain hyperparameters impact the model performance depends on various factors and it is hard to definitively say one hyperparameter is more important than the others and thus needs to be tuned.

All these choices affect how long a hyperparameter tuning job can last.\", \"found_duplicate\": false}\n",
            " {\"question\": \"Can I optimize multiple objectives simultaneously like a model to be both fast and accurate?\", \"answer\": \"Not at this time.

Automatic Model Tuning, on the other hand, is designed to tune any model, no matter whether it is based on built-in algorithms, deep learning frameworks, or custom containers. In exchange for the flexibility, you have to manually pick the specific algorithm, determine the hyperparameters to tune, and corresponding search ranges.\", \"found_duplicate\": false}\n",

In contrast, the goal of reinforcement learning techniques is to learn how to achieve a desired outcome even when it is not clear how to accomplish that outcome.
